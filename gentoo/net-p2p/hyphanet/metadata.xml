		Hyphanet (formerly Freenet) is free software which lets you anonymously
		share files, browse and publish "freesites" (websites accessible only
		through Hyphanet) and chat on forums, all without fear of censorship.

		Hyphanet is decentralized to make it less vulnerable to attack, and if
		used in "darknet" mode, where users only connect to their friends, is
		very difficult to detect.

		Communications by Hyphanet nodes are encrypted and are routed through
		other nodes to make it extremely difficult to determine who is
		requesting the information and what its content is.
